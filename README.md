# Github Pages Boilerplate

## What it is

Simple a starting point for a github pages hosted website. 

* Twitter Bootstrap (sass and customizable)
* jQuery
* HTML and CSS minification

## What it is not

This is not a theme.  It is not designed to be used with bootswatch or some other bootstrap theme or build.  It is therefore better suited for custom site design and devs familiar with using bootstrap.

## Demo Site

The code as is creates this website: http://jekyll.xcsrz.com/

## Roadmap

Some things I will eventually add to this:

* pagination include for blog posts
* a tag cloud
